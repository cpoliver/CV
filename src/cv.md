#### Education

##### National Certificate in Graphic Design
Having learned the fundamentals of Adobe and Macromedia software packages in my early teens, I decided to pursue a career in graphic design. I passed the course with a double merit and went on to work for Sonoco Trident, doing reprographic work for Proctor and Gamble.

##### Advanced IT Apprenticeship
In order to break into the IT industry, I completed the apprenticeship and earned Cisco, CompTIA and Microsoft certifications along the way. These accreditations enabled me to get a job in application support at a successful software house, which eventually led to me becoming a fully-fledged software developer.

#### Awards

##### Starpack – Gold Award
I received this award as part of a national competition for innovation in print and packaging design. The winning project was created whilst studying graphic design at college and helped me secure my job in reprographics. I was presented the award by Sanjay Patel, Packaging Innovation Manager at The Coca-Cola Company.
